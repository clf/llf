This code provides an adequate representation of linear sequent calculus in
LLF and an implementation of cut elimination for this calculs.  The
subdirectory "cll-in-Elf" shows how (laboriously) this problem is tackeled in
Elf.  The language and its representation are described in the following
technical report:
