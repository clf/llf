This directory contains three encodings of the purely multiplicative
fragment of the linear adaptation of the lambda calculus in the style
of Curry:

- hoas.llf: the language is defined using traditional higher-order
  abstract syntax.  Linearity and typing restrictions are enforced
  at the semantic level.

- lhoas.llf: the language is defined using linear higher-order
  abstract syntax.  Only typing restrictions are enforced at the
  semantic level.

- tlhoas.llf: the language is defined using linear higher-order
  abstract syntax and enforces typing restrictions directly.
  Neither typing nor linearity need to be defined at the semantic
  level.

More on these encodings in:

  Iliano Cervesato: "A Linear Logical Framework", Ph. D. thesis,

  English version to appear shortly.
