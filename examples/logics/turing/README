This directory contains an LLF specification of two variants of the
Turing machine.  The transitions of the first have the form:

	symbol * state --> symbol * state * move

the transitions of the second have the form:

	symbol * state --> (symbol | move) * state

It also contains specification for how to transform computations
of one into computations of the other, and vice versa.
